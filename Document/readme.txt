The code file contained in the deliverable zip is :
Naive-Bayes-Spam-Classification/NaiveBayes/NBayes.py

This python file contains all the code for training and testing the classifer. The call to the function parse_file() initiates the training procedure using the training set placed at "Naive-Bayes-Spam-Classification/Training Set/" and as soon as the classifier is trained, it starts testing on the test set placed at "Naive-Bayes-Spam-Classification/Test Set/". It then determines the efficiency of the classifier using the evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score and displays all these metrics values on the console. Thus, this file contains all the logic for training and testing the data. The only task one has to perform is to place training and testing data at proper path specified below. 

==========================================================================================================================================================================

The python version used for the development of this project is : python 3.7

==========================================================================================================================================================================

To run the code in NBayes.py:

-> Place the training set in a folder: 
Naive-Bayes-Spam-Classification/Training Set/

-> Place the training set in a folder: 
Naive-Bayes-Spam-Classification/Test Set


==========================================================================================================================================================================
To execute the code, simply run the NBayes.py file from the IDE and this will produce the resulting files on following path:

Naive-Bayes-Spam-Classification/model.txt
Naive-Bayes-Spam-Classification/result.txt

The values of evaluation metrics precision, accuracy, recall, confusion matrix and F1 Score, will be displayed on the console.
